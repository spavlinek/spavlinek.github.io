# Game Design Work

Explore my game design projects, from algorithm-driven puzzle games to immersive platformers, showcasing innovative mechanics and creative problem-solving.

## Featured Work

### Flytrap Adventures
*Platform: PC | Engine: Custom Framework*  
*January - May 2023*

Created an immersive 2D platformer where players navigate a flytrap through a dynamic greenhouse environment. The game features innovative movement mechanics unique to the flytrap character, environmental storytelling, and dynamic level design that responds to player actions.

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic greenhouse environment with changing conditions
- Unique flytrap-based movement mechanics
- Environmental storytelling through level design
- Custom 2D platformer framework development

### Sudoku Framework
*Platform: PC | Engine: Python*  
*November - December 2022*

Developed a comprehensive Sudoku game framework in Python featuring intelligent hint generation using a backtracking algorithm. The project demonstrates both game design principles and algorithmic problem-solving, creating an educational yet engaging puzzle experience.

**Key Features:**
- Custom Sudoku game framework built from scratch
- Intelligent hint system using backtracking algorithms
- Multiple difficulty levels and puzzle generation
- Clean, intuitive user interface design

## Game Design Philosophy

My approach to game design focuses on:

### Player Experience
Creating engaging and meaningful interactions that challenge players intellectually while maintaining accessibility. Each game is designed to provide clear feedback and progressive learning curves.

### Technical Innovation
Combining creative design with technical implementation, often developing custom frameworks and algorithms to achieve specific gameplay goals. This includes algorithm-driven puzzle mechanics and dynamic environment systems.

### Accessibility & Education
Designing games that are not only entertaining but also educational, with clear rules and helpful systems like hint generation that support learning rather than frustration.

### Environmental Storytelling
Using game environments and mechanics to tell stories, as demonstrated in Flytrap Adventures where the greenhouse setting drives both narrative and gameplay mechanics.

## Design Process

### Research & Concept Development
- Analyzing existing games and mechanics for inspiration
- Identifying unique design opportunities
- Prototyping core mechanics early in development

### Technical Implementation
- Developing custom frameworks when needed
- Algorithm design for game mechanics (like hint generation)
- Balancing technical constraints with creative vision

### Playtesting & Iteration
- Regular testing with diverse player groups
- Iterative refinement based on feedback
- Accessibility testing and improvements
