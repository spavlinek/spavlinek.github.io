**Platform:** Web/Steam  

**Developer:** Thedox Games

**Link:** https://thedoxgames.itch.io/turn-on-the-light-jigsaw

**High-level Instructional Goal**: Develop spatial reasoning and basic electrical circuit logic skills.

### Educational Goals

The apparent learning objectives of _Turn on the Light_ are to encourage players to think spatially and logically about connectivity, mimicking the logic of completing simple electrical circuits. Players need to rotate puzzle pieces to connect paths and light up bulbs, which models the way real circuits require correct connections to function.

The game assumes players have some very basic familiarity with cause-and-effect reasoning but does not expect deep prior knowledge of electricity or circuits. The challenge is more about visual-spatial problem solving than domain-specific science knowledge.
There are possible transfer opportunities to fields that require thinking about connectivity and systems, like electronics, plumbing systems, or even coding practices involving logical pathways. However, the connection to real-world circuit building is fairly surface-level — there is no explicit mention of electricity rules like current direction, resistance, or short circuits.

### Game Elements

The core gameplay loop is very simple:

- **Goal**: Light up all the bulbs by correctly connecting the circuit paths.
- **Actions**: Rotate tiles by clicking them to align wires between tiles and complete a continuous path from the battery to the light bulbs.
- **Nouns**: Battery, wire tiles, bulbs.
- **Verbs**: Rotate, Connect.

There is a “inner loop” of clicking and seeing immediate feedback — if the player rotates a tile correctly, the path becomes visibly closer to completion. There is a “outer loop” in the form of progressing through levels of increasing difficulty.
The player experience is relaxed but slightly challenging, with satisfying visual feedback when the circuit lights up. However, it is very repetitive: every level is a variation on the same mechanic, with little variation beyond increased grid size and complexity.

### Learning Mechanisms

The game mainly supports sense-making: players must understand the spatial relationships between tiles and mentally simulate the connection before acting. Learning science principles used include:

- **Immediate Feedback:** Players instantly see whether their tile rotation created a proper connection (light paths become visible).
- **Low Consequences for Failure:** Mistakes can be corrected with no penalty, encouraging trial-and-error exploration without frustration.
- **Progressive Complexity:** Levels slowly add complexity, aligning with the principle of scaffolding. However, the game does not strongly support deep transfer to real electrical circuit understanding. There is no explanation of why or how electricity flows — it’s purely visual. Without adding explicit explanations or requiring players to predict outcomes before acting, the game mostly supports surface-level pattern recognition rather than true conceptual refinement.

*Level 12, which is already the one I got stuck on because there is no instruction as to how the numbered pieces work and the player has to figure it out themselves.*

### Overall Critique
Overall, _Turn on the Light_ succeeds as a simple, relaxing puzzle game but in my opinion falls short as a meaningful educational tool for understanding circuits. It does build spatial reasoning and some systemic thinking such as the fact that you need to connect the switch to the light bulb and the direction of electricity can be controlled, which could be slightly prepare players for more serious learning. However, without any content about electrical principles, the educational value remains incidental rather than deliberate and players can just learn to pattern match. Due to this it has little transfer ability in my opinion. I can see it being much more effective in a physics classroom setting with verbal  explanations and cues by the teacher.

As a game, it is engaging for short sessions but becomes repetitive without major new mechanics or challenges beyond size increases. As a learning experience, it would need significantly more scaffolding — like introductory concepts or reflection questions — to truly help players transfer knowledge to real-world circuit-building. I would judge it as a fun puzzle game, but a weak educational game unless paired with additional instructional material.
