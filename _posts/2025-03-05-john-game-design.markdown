## Moments
In the fiction of the game, John is a crazy man in Minneapolis who is controlled by Voices in his head (the players) with each voice trying to fulfill their own bizarre obsessions while maintaining control over his actions. One session might see John attempting to become mayor, only to get distracted by a burning desire to collect every hat in sight. Another could involve a high-speed chase through Minneapolis as multiple Voices struggle to control John’s reckless actions.


## Moods
Everyone is John blends dark humor with storytelling. The tone is often ridiculous and unpredictable, ranging from slapstick misadventures to moments of unexpected brilliance as John miraculously accomplishes feats despite his incompetence. The game encourages improvisation, player rivalry, and sheer creative mayhem, making every session a unique and entertaining experience.


## Mechanics 
Players take on the roles of voices in John’s head, each trying to fulfill their own bizarre obsessions while maintaining control over his actions. One player acts as the GM, narrating John’s chaotic journey through life. Each Voice has three defining traits:
- Willpower: A resource used to bid for control of John and boost success chances.
- Skills: Two or three unique proficiencies that increase success rates for certain actions.
- Obsession: A personal goal ranging from the mundane to the absurd, which determines the win condition.

John’s control changes frequently, as Voices bid Willpower when he wakes up, fails an action, or completes an obsession. Players must carefully manage their Willpower, choosing when to seize control or conserve resources for later opportunities. When rolling for actions, a 3+ on a d6 succeeds if the action aligns with a Voice’s skills; otherwise, a 6 is needed—unless Willpower is spent to improve the odds. Play continues until all Voices run out of Willpower, at which point scores are calculated based on how many times each obsession was achieved, weighted by its difficulty. The highest score determines the winner, who usually takes on the role of GM for the next session.



## Overall Critique 
I was drawn to this game because the game concept and storyline seemed very amusing to me. I like the concept of each player playing Voices inside of John’s head and basically competing over who gets to control John more. I am impressed that despite the game being very simple, it is engaging and leads to humorous storylines (if played with the correct people). The mechanics are simple yet incredibly effective—bidding for control of John creates a constant push-and-pull that keeps players engaged, and the obsession system ensures that every session is wildly unpredictable. Also, since each Voice is active in only short bursts of time like 10 minutes, I liked how the game forces you to think in short bursts of control rather than a long-form narrative. 

Unlike traditional role-playing games where you inhabit a single character, here you’re constantly battling for fleeting moments of influence over John’s bizarre life. It turns every decision into a high-stakes gamble, where the risk isn’t just failing an action but also losing control entirely. It is a very open-ended and creative game, however this can be a drawback if played with people who like structured storytelling, as the game provides basically no structure and the players need to do everything themselves, from Voice creation to the actual stories. If I did this game myself I would at least provide names for the Voices such as “the crazy one” or “the diabolical one” to make the character creation a bit easier.
