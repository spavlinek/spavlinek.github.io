## Moments
The player plays as a traveler journeying across the Hæthland. They travel from place to place through a lush pastoral world, meeting new friends, helping communities heal, uncovering small local myths, and reckoning with personal and collective trauma. A “moment” might be sharing a picnic with a lonely fox, mending a bridge damaged by a storm, or honoring the memory of a spirit resting beneath an old oak tree. The game flows like a gentle road trip, stitched together with small acts of kindness, memory, and change.

## Moods
Wanderhome’s tone is consistently gentle, reflective, and hopeful. I would say the genre is like a “cozy” fantasy. The mood is melancholic, tender, whimsical, occasionally bittersweet. While it sometimes deals with the aftermath of war and trauma, it always leans toward healing, growth, and soft moments of connection rather than confrontation or violence.

## Mechanics 
Wanderhome focuses on narrative choices and emotional storytelling rather than stats or dice rolls.
- Players create animalfolk characters by choosing playbooks, each representing a type of archetype or role (like the Caretaker or the Firelight). Instead of dice rolls, characters take actions described in their playbook that either cost or earn tokens.
- Tokens are spent to take significant actions, often relating to change, transformation, or vulnerability, while other actions are freely taken to color the world.
- The world is collaboratively built as players move through different "kith" (villages, crossroads, forests, etc.), prompted by landscape and seasonal questions.

## Overall Critique 
I absolutely love Wanderhome. It is such a calming game with studio ghibli-esque vibes. The way it shifts focus away from conflict and "winning" toward healing and journeying feels so refreshing compared to traditional RPGs, and is exactly the kind of game I’m trying to make as my final project for my designing TTRPGs class. I’m especially drawn to how easy it is to just start: there’s no complex stat blocks or dice probabilities to learn — it's about emotion, character, and atmosphere. I can easily imagine telling a story about a tired old goat carrying the memory of a fallen kingdom on his back, accompanied by a mischievous rabbit who paints murals in every village they pass through. I love the idea of creating little vignettes of places, each with their own bittersweet memory.

As a designer, I’m really inspired by Wanderhome’s use of tokens as emotional currency. I could see reinterpreting that system in a sci-fi setting, where instead of "tokens," players spend "moments of hope" or "memories of Earth" as they travel through space, carrying their history with them. Wanderhome reminds me that TTRPGs can be soft, slow, and beautiful—and that can be just as meaningful (or more!) than fighting dragons. The art is stunning as well, and ties into the vibes of the game really well, as it reminds of storybooks I used to read as a child.
