## Moments
In iXe, players take on the role of a digital avatar navigating The Grid, a mysterious and expansive cyberspace world. The game invites players to explore different digital realms, interact with non-playable characters, and uncover secrets hidden within the world. Moments in the game might involve hacking into secure databases, battling rogue AIs, or forming unexpected alliances with other digital beings.


## Moods
iXe captures the essence of cyberpunk, digital utopia, and virtual escapism with a sprinkle of anime. Depending on how it’s played, the game can take on different tones:
- Wacky & Fun (like Wreck-It Ralph)—quirky interactions between video game characters.
- Serious & Philosophical (The Matrix, Tron)—questions of identity, free will, and AI ethics.
- High-Stakes & Action-Packed (Ready Player One)—competitive hacking, cyber-battles, and faction conflicts.
- Exploratory & Reflective—a meditative journey through a vast digital realm


## Mechanics 
The gameplay is based on card draws, storytelling prompts (“Oracles”), and trait-based interactions. The game is structured around Scenes which are short narrative bursts that advance the story. Gameplay follows a cycle of drawing prompts, roleplaying, and resolving challenges using the Fate Deck. There are 3 types of scenes:
- Action: Exploration, combat, acquisition, gathering resources.
- Interaction: Bonding, interrogation, social encounters.
- Montage: Recovery, training, crafting, character development.

Once the player chooses a scene type they draw cards and consult “oracles” (extensive prompt tables) to drive the storytelling forward. Resolving Challenges and Conflicts is also done by drawing cards. Two cards are drawn to form a Base Range (lower and upper values). Then the player draws a card from their hand (the Challenge Card). This is compared to the Base Range—success or failure depends on its value relative to the range. Character traits can give potential modifiers or narrative bonuses. The characters can also buy things using tokens and use them to keep track of their character traits.

## Overall Critique 
This was my first time attempting to play such a large solo game (over 100 pages!), but it was an interesting experience. I really liked the variety of different possible Grid worlds, which made the game feel expansive and full of potential, as well as the amount of detail that each world had. I was provided with not only an overview of the world but also multiple festivals and celebrations, factions, NPCs, territories and terrains. I truly felt immersed in this world and I think I would like to include a similar approach in my own solo game, allowing for diverse settings and unique storytelling opportunities. One of my favorite mechanics was the Oracle system, which functioned as a massive table of prompts and questions to guide the narrative (it was really really big, there were even Name Oracles). It made storytelling feel organic while still providing structure, and I could see myself using a similar mechanic in future solo designs. I also appreciated how flexible the game was in terms of playstyle. While I played it as a solo experience, I liked that it could also be played with a GM or as a co-op game. Having those different modes makes it adaptable to different types of players, which is something I find really appealing in a TTRPG. The artwork was also stunning and very evocative. 

If I were to modify iXe, I might incorporate more real-world tie-ins (this is my inner CS nerd talking) such as using real-world websites or coding challenges as part of the game’s hacking mechanics. Overall, iXe feels like a love letter to digital culture, gaming, and storytelling. I did a solo session with a character inspired by Big Hero 6, but I’d love to run a session where the characters are glitched-out NPCs trying to reclaim their lost data.
