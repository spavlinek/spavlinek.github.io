# NoriLLA - A fun way to teach STEM to children


![NoriLLA](/assets/images/games/norilla.webp)

**Platform:** PC, specialized table & camera  

**Developer:** CMU, led by Dr. Nesra Yannier  

**Link:** https://www.norilla.com/

**High-level Instructional Goal**: To teach children fundamental STEM principles through hands-on, interactive, and experimental learning. It integrates physical and digital play to improve scientific thinking, collaboration, and engagement.

### Educational Goals

NoRILLA aims to enhance children’s understanding of physics and has several different versions of the game — one teaching stability and structural integrity, another teaching about friction and air resistance and a third teaching weight and balance. NoRILLA is designed for children with little to no formal physics knowledge. It assumes that players can follow basic instructions and engage with physical objects, they don’t even need to know how to read. The game guides players through exercises where they build structures and receive real-time feedback from an AI system. Each exercise is structured such that the children first develop a hypothesis, then test it, see the result and then try and interpret the results. This mimics real-world scientific thinking and testing of hypotheses, so it can transfer to engineering, physics, and even constructing buildings.


### Game Elements

**Core Gameplay Loop:**
- Players receive a building task
- Build physical structures (towers, cars, etc.) on the NoRILLA table
- Hypothesize what will happen when the table shakes
- Table actually shakes to test the structure
- AI prompts explanation of results
- Iterate on designs based on feedback

**Inner Loop:** Players receive a challenge → construct → test → receive feedback

**Outer Loop:** Apply learned concepts to increasingly complex structures and challenges

**Game Components:**
- **Nouns:** Blocks, towers, platforms, weights
- **Verbs:** Build, test, hypothesize, analyze, refine

**Player Experience:** Learners actively experiment and refine their designs rather than passively absorbing information. The AI feedback system encourages iterative learning.

### Learning Mechanisms

The game promotes sense-making, memory, and refinement by guiding students to observe, predict, and refine their designs based on real-world physics principles:

- **Scaffolding:** The system gradually increases difficulty and adjusts based on player performance (supports memory/fluency)

- **Real-time Feedback:** AI feedback shows immediate consequences of design choices (supports memory/fluency)

- **Worked Examples:** AI provides illustrated step-by-step solutions (supports induction/refinement)

- **Cognitive Dissonance:** System presents incorrect explanation options to encourage critical thinking and argumentation around key concepts (builds sense-making/understanding)

- **Self-Explanation Prompts:** Players explain their reasoning and predictions, encouraging reflection on their building process (builds sense-making/understanding)

- **Multimedia Experience:** Graphics, audio, and tactile elements enhance engagement (builds sense-making/understanding)

### Overall Critique

I am a part of the current team developing NoRILLA and I think (although slightly biased) that NoRILLA is a good example of an effective educational game. Not only because I write the research that says so, but I've also played it many times and have seen kids play it. It pretty successfully balances engagement and learning by integrating actual physical interaction with real-time feedback and engaging graphics. The interactive and exploratory nature of NoRILLA makes it an enjoyable and engaging game. The iterative process where each level gets more and more challenging keeps players invested. The thing I like the most is how it teaches the concepts by encouraging experimentation and critical thinking on top of also providing a multimedia player experience.

I think the only potential limitation is how much specific hardware and setup the game requires, which may limit accessibility in some settings. Also, so far all of the NoRILLA games are trying to teach physic concepts, and I'm not sure how its learning applications might be applied beyond structural engineering concepts.
