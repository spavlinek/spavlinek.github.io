## Moments
The player takes on the role of a wanderer, setting off on a journey full of challenges. The narrative moments in Her Odyssey revolve around self-discovery and exploration. The player may encounter mysterious figures, face internal struggles, or come across significant events that shape their character’s growth. These moments could include reflective episodes or challenges, like deciding whether to return home or continue wandering. 


## Moods
While the genre is flexible—players can craft their journey in ways that fit fantasy, sci-fi, historical drama, or realism—the emotional weight of the game tends to skew towards drama. Her Odyssey leans heavily into a reflective, melancholic, and introspective mood. The tone can shift between somber and hopeful, depending on the direction the player chooses for their character’s journey. It’s a narrative-driven game, so the mood will heavily depend on the player's reflections and the direction they take their wanderer. There are opportunities for the player’s character to die even.


## Mechanics 
Gameplay revolves around drawing cards from a deck to determine the challenges your wanderer faces on a specific day and then rolling a die to face these challenges. Each card represents a Hazard, and the suit and number on the card dictate the nature of the challenge and its severity. The numerical value of the card (Omen Score) indicates how difficult the challenge is. The player must then use their wanderer's stats to attempt to overcome the Hazard. To resolve a challenge, the player rolls a number of 4-sided dice (d4s) equal to the stat being used, taking the highest roll as the result. The outcome determines whether the wanderer succeeds or faces complications, with potential for success, partial success, or failure.

The outcome of the checks will define whether the day is Auspicious (successful) or Inauspicious (failure). If the wanderer's stat checks meet or exceed the Omen Score, the day is considered Auspicious, and the wanderer progresses favorably. If not, it’s Inauspicious, leading to setbacks or sacrifices. As the journey unfolds, the wanderer's stats will fluctuate based on the day's events—Auspicious days lead to decreases in stats, while Inauspicious days provide opportunities for growth. Additionally, the game introduces the concept of False and True Homecomings (drawing a joker card), marking key milestones where the wanderer’s journey reaches a turning point and finally a conclusion.

## Overall Critique 
Again, as is a theme for many of these entries, I was surprised as to how much I liked this game - I am not a creative writer but I made a story about a girl named Luna, who was searching for a new home after her friend died (the friend’s ghost haunted her), set in some Scotland-esque fantasy world. 

I really liked the mechanic where each stat decreases by one after a successful day, symbolizing the physical and emotional toll the journey is taking on the wanderer. It's a subtle yet effective way of capturing the fatigue and exhaustion that comes with traveling and enduring challenges. It feels like a natural consequence, making each day's progress feel more significant and is a nice pacing mechanic. The Hopecomings are another clever pacing mechanic. By introducing the False and True Homecomings, the game provides natural milestones for the story. These milestones guide the wanderer toward an eventual conclusion, throwing a “twist” in the middle. It’s a nice way to break up the flow of the journey, making it feel like there’s real progression. 
The “Hope” mechanic is also nice. It gives a tangible way to track the wanderer's emotional state. There are a lot of “add-ons,” like the Hour of Doom, which introduces real stakes and a sense of danger, where the traveler could die. This flexibility means players can tweak the experience to suit their desired level of risk or narrative focus. If I were to make a game, I would also like to include customizations such as this.

I sometimes struggled to come up with challenges, as they were offered only as keywords such as “an illness” or “a trap”, but this can be a real positive for some people as it gives them more creative freedom. I think the game had well thought out pacing, which made me feel like I was heading towards a conclusion.
