## Moments
In the fiction of the game, you are the keeper of a tea shop on the threshold between life and death. Visitors, all recently deceased, stop by for a final drink and moment of reflection before they continue to the Great Beyond. Each visitor arrives from a foggy, shifting world that seems untethered from time, bearing unfinished business, regrets, hidden joys, or simple humanity. The story is built one tea session at a time—through questions and the gentle progression of time. Visitors are sometimes joyful, other times lost or mourning. You are their quiet companion for this liminal moment. There is no combat or grand quest. But there is grief, closure, healing, and gentle goodbyes.

## Moods
I would say the genre is fantasy, with elements of afterlife and magical realism. The tone is quiet, reflective, bittersweet and occasionally heartwarming or tragic. The misty, fog-draped setting echoes the tone of a Studio Ghibli epilogue or the contemplative vibe of Spirited Away's quieter scenes. You’re encouraged to slow down, notice small details, and imagine not what happens next, but what has already passed.

## Mechanics 
- Rolls of a d6 determine:
    - The visitor who arrives
    - The weather, which also sets their emotional tone
    - Tea ingredients at the beginning and as gifts
    - The passage of days (tracking toward the game’s end)
- Tea recipes use a kind of crafting system where players combine found ingredients to prepare teas, each with narrative or emotional effects.
- Question prompts are the core of storytelling. You ask each visitor personal, evocative questions and write your responses as journal entries.
- On subsequent days, you ask: “How did you know my last customer?” which weaves an interconnection between visitors and leads to emergent storytelling.
- The game ends once the Days total reaches 24 and the Veiled One arrives for the final ritual.

## Overall Critique 
What a delightful little game. No need for 100 pages, no need for fancy artwork. This game was a single page, was incredibly simple, and yet was built on such an engaging idea. I was drawn to it because it had a very interesting (and for some people repelling) theme of death, spirits and the underworld. I like that there’s no pressure to create an epic; instead, it rewards slowness and emotional nuance. I think the interwoven stories, when visitors begin to reference each other, are where the real magic happens. That mechanic of asking, “How did you know my last customer?” makes it feel like your little corner of the afterlife is real, alive, and layered with meaning and I really really liked that. I also loved the use of tea as both a literal and metaphorical tool. The whole mechanic with collecting ingredients and then having the effects of the tea help the visitor was all very lovely. I liked how the weather affects the mood and that the ingredients gifted feel like real-world relics: “feather moss,” “ancient seashell,” “ginkgo leaf.” They weren’t just fantasy props but symbolic objects, which helped anchor emotion.


I'd love to build a companion game where you play as a departed spirit after leaving the shop—perhaps using your final tea as a kind of magical memory that guides your last journey. I could also see adapting the mechanics to a forest shrine or cemetery caretaker setting, where visitors are living people but come to process grief.
