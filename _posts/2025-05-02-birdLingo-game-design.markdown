**Platform:** Web, Steam  

**Developer:** Jessica Liebing and Caitlin Huxley

## Educational Goals

Its primary learning objectives are:

1. To build auditory recognition skills for different European bird songs
2. To associate specific bird songs with their corresponding species
3. To understand habitat contexts where various birds are typically found
4. To distinguish between similar-sounding bird calls through comparative learning

The game assumes minimal prior bird identification knowledge, making it accessible to beginner bird watchers. However, it does expect the players to have the ability to discern between different songs. The knowledge gained could transfer to real-world birdwatching, environmental education and research, and even just an increased appreciation of natural soundscapes in daily life.

## Game Elements
The core gameplay loop is very simple but still effective:

1. Listen to bird song(s)
2. Select the correct bird from provided options
3. Receive feedback

The game is structured around different habitats (grasslands, gardens, farmlands, parks, and seaside), each containing its own set of birds to identify. As a player, my primary verbs are “listen” and “select,” while the nouns include bird species, habitats, and songs.

The player experience is deliberately “cute and relaxing,” with a progressive difficulty curve. Early levels feature single bird songs with more guidance, while advanced levels challenge players with multiple simultaneous bird songs across different habitats, which is meant to simulate real-world walking and identifying birds. There is also a Bird Library, which serves as both a progress tracker and knowledge repository.

## Learning Mechanisms 
BirdLingo primarily employs a fluency-building mechanism through deliberate practice. Several learning science principles it uses are:

1. **Spaced Repetition:** The game repeatedly exposes players to bird songs across multiple sessions with varied recordings of the same bird song, strengthening memory retention.
2. **Progressive Scaffolding:** The game starts with significant assistance that gradually fades as player skill increases. For example, it starts off with providing song descriptions with each bird, then only provides a written description of the song being guessed, and ultimately no written description of a song.
3. **Contextual Learning:** By organizing birds by habitat, the game provides meaningful context for when and where certain songs might be heard, aiding in mental organization and retrieval. It also does this by providing recordings with mixed bird songs, mimicking what players might actually hear in the forest.
4. **Deliberate Difficulty:** The game intentionally pairs similar-sounding birds together, creating productive struggle that enhances discrimination abilities.
5. **Optional Depth:** The Bird Library provides additional information for those seeking deeper understanding, accommodating different learning preferences.
These mechanisms directly support the educational goals by building pattern recognition skills through structured, repeated exposure with carefully calibrated difficulty.

## Overall Critique 
I personally love birds and have been an avid birdwatcher since I was a child. However, I have never managed to learn their bird songs, so this game proved to be an effective way of doing so.

In my eyes, BirdLingo is a successful educational game for several reasons. As a game, it succeeds by maintaining an engaging loop with clear progression while keeping mechanics simple. The cute visuals and relaxing atmosphere make what could be a daunting learning task more approachable . I also liked the habitat-based organization, which provided a natural level progression and also gave context relating to the real-world.

As a learning experience, BirdLingo excels by using the scaffolded approach, repetition with variation, and contextual organization which are all effective for building pattern recognition abilities.

The game’s most notable strength in my opinion is how it simulates the real-world challenge of bird identification in increasingly authentic ways, ending in scenarios that mimic actual field conditions with multiple overlapping songs. This authentic practice likely creates strong transfer to real birdwatching situations.

One potential improvement might be more explicit metacognitive prompting to help players reflect on their learning strategies, though the Bird Library may already serve this purpose to some extent as it shows which bird the player “got wrong” the last time they played a level.
