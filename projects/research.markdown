# Research

I am currently interested in studying the intersection of AI-assisted learning and human-computer interaction, two fields that I think  are the future of education. When I started my academic journey, I was interested in computational biology, but I left that interest behind after becoming exposed to the domain of Technology-enhanced learning research. You may recognize some of these as also a part of my technical projects, but here I discuss the research behind them rather than the code.

### AI-Assisted Learning
*Institution: NoriLLA | Duration: June 2024 - Present*

This research explores how adaptive feedback, powered by AI and computer vision, can enhance children’s science learning during real-world engineering construction activities. By providing real-time, personalized support, the system helps students better understand scientific concepts and apply them meaningfully while building. You can read our paper on using NoRILLA to investigate how sequencing scientific inquiry activities before engineering activities encourages the transfer of scientific principles.

I also analyzed conversational data using OpenAI's Whisper to extract insights about AI-assisted learning patterns and effectiveness of augmented reality games developed by NoriLLA. This research investigates how AI tools can better support educational outcomes by understanding natural language interactions between students, their parents and AI systems. Research paper is in the works!

### Simulated Facial Expression Generation
*Institution: CMU RASL | Duration: September 2023 - May 2024*

Designed and implemented a Python-based face model using PyQt5 for dynamic facial expression transitions. The research focused on different forms of robot feedback (verbal and non-verbal) and how that can affect human performance in the context of a personal fitness trainer robot. If you're interested read Roshni Kaushik's dissertation on it!
