# Research

I am currently interested in studying the intersection of AI-assisted learning and human-computer interaction, two fields that I think  are the future of education. When I started my academic journey, I was interested in computational biology, but I left that interest behind after becoming exposed to the domain of Technology-enhanced learning research. You may recognize some of these as also a part of my technical projects, but here I discuss the research behind them rather than the code.


### AI-Assisted Learning Analysis
*Institution: NoriLLA | Duration: June 2024 - Present*

Analyzing conversational data using OpenAI's Whisper to extract insights about AI-assisted learning patterns and effectiveness. This research investigates how AI tools can better support educational outcomes by understanding natural language interactions between students and AI systems.

**Research Focus:**
- Natural language processing for educational data
- Pattern recognition in AI-assisted learning interactions
- Effectiveness metrics for AI educational tools
- Human-AI interaction in learning environments
