# Technical Projects

Here you'll find a collection of my technical projects done outside of schoolwork. Most of these were done during hackathons and so are thus half-done.

### Simulated Facial Expression Generation Project
*Technologies: Python, PyQt5*  
*CMU RASL | September 2023 - May 2024*

Designed and implemented a Python-based facial model using PyQt5 to simulate dynamic, real-time expression transitions driven by customizable emotion percentages. Successfully integrated the system into a personal trainer robot to enable expressive, responsive interactions—demonstrating key applications in human-robot interaction and embodied AI. The model supported smooth emotional blending and real-time adaptability, enhancing the robot’s social presence and user engagement.

### 'SobStory' 
*Technologies: Python*  
*TartanHacks 2023*

SobStory is a social media app demo built using python that allowed users to log their emotions and connect with others as a way to destigmatize conversations around emotions and break social norms. Features: logging sobs, auto-generated statistics of sobs (reasons, yearly overview), resources to access (including a disco dance party!), social connection with other users, custom settings, and more!

### 'Vesmir'
*Technologies: HTML, JavaScript, Spotify API*  
*HackCMU 2023*

Vesmir is an immersive, space-themed web app that transforms users' Spotify data into a personalized “music universe.” By visualizing listening habits as celestial bodies, Vesmir allows users to explore their own musical galaxy and discover new artists by journeying through the universes of others. It blends personalization, exploration, and discovery to make music feel cosmic.

### VERVIT Mobile App
*Technologies: Flutter, Android Studios*  
*March - November 2021*

VERVIT is a mobile app built to help seniors navigate digital technology with confidence. Inspired by the isolation faced by elderly individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, the app focused on accessibility, intuitive navigation, and simplified interfaces to promote digital inclusion. As the head of the design in addition to being a programmer, I conducted hands-on testing with older users to iteratively refine the design and ensure every interaction was tailored to their needs.
