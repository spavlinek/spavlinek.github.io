# Technical Projects

Here you'll find a collection of my technical projects done outside of schoolwork. You'll see the computer games I've developed, as well as some of the apps I've worked on. Most of these were done during hackathons and so are thus half-done.

### Simulated Facial Expression Generation Project
*Technologies: Python, PyQt5*  
*CMU RASL | September 2023 - May 2024*

Designed and implemented a Python-based facial model using PyQt5 to simulate dynamic, real-time expression transitions driven by customizable emotion percentages. Successfully integrated the system into a personal trainer robot to enable expressive, responsive interactions—demonstrating key applications in human-robot interaction and embodied AI. The model supported smooth emotional blending and real-time adaptability, enhancing the robot’s social presence and user engagement.

### VERVIT Mobile App
*Technologies: Flutter, Android Studios*  
*March - November 2021*

VERVIT is a mobile app built to help seniors navigate digital technology with confidence. Inspired by the isolation faced by elderly individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic, the app focused on accessibility, intuitive navigation, and simplified interfaces to promote digital inclusion. As the head of the design in addition to being a programmer, I conducted hands-on testing with older users to iteratively refine the design and ensure every interaction was tailored to their needs.
