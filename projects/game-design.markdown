# Game Design Projects

### Whispers of the Forest
*Table-top roleplaying game*  
*April 2025*

Whispers of the Forest is a solo journaling RPG. You are either a Traveler or a Guardian of an ancient temple deep within a mystical forest. The forest is home to demons, spirits, and ancient guardians, each of whom wears a mask. As you explore, you'll document your journey through journal entries prompted by a standard deck of cards.

This game was designed as the final project for the class Little Games/Big Stories: TTRPG Design Studio. It was inspired by the games Anamnesis and Her Odyssey and by my childhood favorites Princess Mononoke and Natsumer's Book of Friends. My favorite part of it is that each player gets to create their own mask through play.

**This game contains:**
 * Solo journaling RPG mechanics
 * Two distinct character archetypes (Traveler and Guardian)
 * Standard deck of cards story prompts
 * Creative mask-making system
