# Game Design Projects

### Whispers of the Forest
*Table-top roleplaying game*  
*April 2025*

Whispers of the Forest is a solo journaling RPG. You are either a Traveler or a Guardian of an ancient temple deep within a mystical forest. The forest is home to demons, spirits, and ancient guardians, each of whom wears a mask. As you explore, you'll document your journey through journal entries prompted by a standard deck of cards.

This game was designed as the final project for the class Little Games/Big Stories: TTRPG Design Studio. It was inspired by the games Anamnesis and Her Odyssey and by my childhood favorites Princess Mononoke and Natsumer's Book of Friends. My favorite part of it is that each player gets to create their own mask through play.

A 2D platformer where players navigate a flytrap through a dynamic greenhouse environment.

### Exciting Ecosystem
*Physical educational game*  
*November 2024*

Exciting Ecosystem is a strategic card game inspired by Unstable Unicorns, where players compete to cultivate the most vibrant and diverse garden using plant and pollinator cards. The game encourages interaction, strategy, and a bit of chaos, as players can influence each other's gardens while building their own. It is an educational game that is meant to teach players about the personal and societal benefits of native plants over a traditional grass-only lawn, and make them curious about changing their own lawns. 

This game was designed as the final project for the class Transformational Game Design Studio and it was one of my favorite game classes.
