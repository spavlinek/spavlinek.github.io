I'm actively engaged in research that explores the intersection of artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, and educational technology. My work focuses on understanding how AI systems can better support learning and how interactive technologies can enhance human experiences.

## Current Research Positions

### Research Assistant & Programming Intern
**NoriLLA** | *June 2024 - Present*

I'm currently working on two primary research projects:

**AI-Assisted Learning Analysis**  
Analyzing conversational data using OpenAI's Whisper to extract insights about AI-assisted learning patterns and effectiveness. This research investigates how AI tools can better support educational outcomes by understanding natural language interactions between students and AI systems.

**Augmented Reality & Computer Vision**  
Developing an augmented reality balancing game that utilizes computer vision for real-time interaction. This project explores applications of AR in physical activity, skill development, and the integration of digital experiences with physical movement.

### Research Experience
**CMU RASL** | *September 2023 - May 2024*

Designed and implemented a Python-based face model using PyQt5 for dynamic facial expression transitions. The research focused on creating realistic facial expressions for human-robot interaction applications, particularly in educational and therapeutic contexts.

## Research Interests

My research spans several interconnected areas:

- **AI-Assisted Learning:** Understanding how artificial intelligence can enhance educational experiences
- **Human-Computer Interaction:** Designing more intuitive and effective human-technology interfaces
- **Computer Vision & AR:** Developing real-time interactive systems using computer vision
- **Educational Technology:** Creating tools that support learning and skill development
- **Game Design Research:** Exploring how game mechanics can be applied to educational contexts

## Past Research Experience

### Computational Biology Research
**Institute of Biotechnology CAS** | *July - August 2023*

Performed large-scale data analysis using R and developed Linux pipelines for genome alignment and peak calling. This interdisciplinary experience demonstrated the application of computational methods to biological research problems.

## Academic Foundation

Currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science** at Carnegie Mellon University with an **HCI concentration** and **Game Design minor**. Relevant coursework includes:

- Introduction to Machine Learning
- Design and Analysis of Algorithms
- Designing Human-Centered Software
- Computer Graphics
- Transformational Game Design Studio

## Publications & Presentations

*Publications and presentations coming soon as current research projects reach completion.*

## Teaching & Research Mentorship

As a **Teaching Assistant for Fundamentals of Programming (Python)**, I support 30+ students through recitations, office hours, and individual tutoring. This teaching experience directly informs my research on AI-assisted learning by providing insights into how students learn programming concepts.
