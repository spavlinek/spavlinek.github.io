# Welcome!

I'm Sara Pavlinek, a computer science senior at Carnegie Mellon University with an interest in game design and human-computer interaction. I enjoy combining my technical skills with creative visions to build products with meaningful interactive experiences and conduct research in AI-assisted learning.

## Featured Work

### Simulated Facial Expression Generation
*CMU RASL Research Project*

Designed and implemented a Python-based face model using PyQt5 for dynamic facial expression transitions, integrated into a personal trainer robot for real-time interactions.
