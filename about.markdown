## Background

I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm exploring the intersection of game design, computer science, and human-computer interaction. I approach problems with both strong technical skills and a creative mind.

## Beyond Work
When I'm not behind the computer, you will most likely find me somewhere in nature or curled up in front of the TV playing hours of Legend of Zelda. I enjoy rock climbing, running, biking, hiking, or even just plain walking. I also love to travel to experience new things and learn about different cultures.
