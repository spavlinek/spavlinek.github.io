## Background

I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm exploring the intersection of game design, computer science, and human-computer interaction. I approach problems with both strong technical skills and a creative mind.


## What I Do

### Technical Development
I build software solutions that solve real problems, from mobile apps to research tools. My technical experience spans from developing core features for the app Mosh using Swift, Firebase, and Google Cloud during my internship at Confetti, to creating augmented reality balancing games utilizing computer vision at NoriLLA.

### Research & Teaching
I'm actively involved in research, currently working as a Research Assistant at NoriLLA where I analyze conversational data using OpenAI's Whisper to extract insights about AI-assisted learning. I also served as a Teaching Assistant for Fundamentals of Programming, where I lead recitations for 30 students and hosted office hours and tutoring sessions.

### Game Design
I create games that challenge players to think differently and engage with innovative mechanics. My game design projects include developing digital games such as "Flytrap Adventures," a 2D platformer set in a dynamic greenhouse environment, or a custom Python-base Sudoku, as well as transformational physical games meant to teach about the environment.

## Technical Expertise

**Programming Languages:** Python, C, Swift, C++, SML, Processing, JavaScript, HTML, R, Flutter  
**Software/Tools:** XCode, Android Studio, Unity, Figma, Latex  
**Specializations:** Machine Learning, Computer Graphics, HCI, Game Design, Data Analysis

## Beyond Work

I've also led successful hackathon projects, including winning the Meta Challenge at HackCMU 2022 with "Grow," a virtual plant-growing experience.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in new opportunities, collaborations, and conversations about game design, technology, and innovation. Feel free to [reach out](/contact/) if you'd like to discuss potential projects or just say hello!
