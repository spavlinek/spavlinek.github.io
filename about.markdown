    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="about-intro">Hi, I'm Sara Pavlinek! I'm a senior at CMU, majoring in computer science with a human-computer interaction concentration and game design minor, passionate about creating meaningful interactive experiences through technology. That's a pretty basic introduction, but you need one when talking to someone for the first time. Thanks for visiting my site :) </p>

## Background

I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where I'm exploring the intersection of game design, computer science, and human-computer interaction.

So, how did I get here? If you’d asked 13-year-old Sara what she wanted to be when she grew up, she would have blurted out *“biology!”* or just *“science!”* right away. But then one day before starting freshman year of highschool, I was flipping through elective classes with my older brother, trying to choose one extra one.

*“Introduction to Programming? What does that even mean?”*

*“Uuuuuu, you should take that — you get to write code like a hacker.”*
 
And so, a hacker I became. I still remember spending hours on one particular homework assignment: a simple canvas with a house on it, meant to teach us about shapes in Python. But I went above and beyond, including silly additions such as making the canvas toggle between daylight and night, complete with twinkling star animations. There was just something about the mix of logic and creativity in programming that biology never gave me.


I'm still searching for what *exactly* I want to do as a computer scientist, but so far I've been enjoying bridging the gap between engineering and design. I would like to combine my software engineering knowledge with my eye for design to create functional and beautiful products that are fun and engaging to use. 

## Beyond Work
As you can probably tell from my landing page, I love plants and games. When I’m not behind the computer, you’ll usually find me out in nature. I love rock climbing, running, biking, hiking — really, any sport that gets me moving. If I’m not outside, I’m probably at home tending my ever-growing jungle of plants or trying to beat my latest Zelda game.
